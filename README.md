# GraphQL-Typescript-Server
This is my boilerplate starter code for a typescript-graphql backend server.
The server includes user authentification, password hashing, email confirmation using redis, testing with jest, and more features to come.
The databse connection is to a postgres sql database.

Redis server should be running while this server is running (mac installation: http://www.codebind.com/mac-osx/install-redis-mac-osx/)
